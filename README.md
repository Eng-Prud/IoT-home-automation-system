IoT Home Automation System
Welcome to the IoT Home Automation System! This project aims to create a comprehensive home automation solution that allows users to control various devices remotely, ensuring convenience, energy efficiency, and enhanced security in their homes.

Project Scope
The IoT Home Automation System covers the following aspects:

Backend Development: Utilizes Node.js and Express.js to build the server-side logic for handling requests and managing device data.
Database Setup: Integrates MongoDB as the database solution for storing device information and user data.
Security Measures: Implements Helmet middleware and basic authentication to enhance server security and protect against potential vulnerabilities.
Frontend Interface: Provides a user-friendly frontend interface for interacting with the system, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
API Integration: Creates RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend interface and the backend server.
Testing: Conducts thorough testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of the system, including unit tests and integration tests.
Hardware Setup: Offers guidance on setting up IoT devices and connecting them to the system for remote control and monitoring.
Project Objectives
At the end of the project, the IoT Home Automation System should be able to:

Allow users to remotely control and monitor various devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras.
Provide real-time updates on device status and enable users to receive notifications for important events.
Ensure secure access to the system through authentication mechanisms and encryption protocols.
Optimize energy usage by allowing users to schedule device operations and monitor energy consumption.
Enhance home security by integrating with surveillance systems and implementing automated security protocols.
