# AI-Based Predictive Maintenance

## Overview
In our IoT Home Automation System, one of the standout features is the AI-based predictive maintenance algorithm. This algorithm is designed to predict when maintenance is needed for various home devices before a failure occurs. By leveraging machine learning, we can analyze sensor data and predict potential issues, ensuring that users can address them proactively. This not only enhances the efficiency and lifespan of devices but also provides peace of mind for homeowners.

## Algorithm Details
The predictive maintenance algorithm uses data collected from various sensors to forecast the health and performance of home devices. It can detect patterns and anomalies that may indicate the need for maintenance. For example, if a temperature sensor consistently reports higher-than-normal readings for a device, the algorithm might predict that the device is overheating and may require maintenance soon.

## Code Explanation
Below is a simplified version of the AI-based predictive maintenance function. In a real-world scenario, this function would involve more complex machine learning models and data processing.

### Code: `maintenancePredictor.js`
```javascript
/**
 * Function to predict maintenance needs based on sensor data
 * @param {Object} sensorData - The data collected from various sensors
 * @returns {Boolean} - Returns true if maintenance is needed, false otherwise
 */
const predictMaintenance = (sensorData) => {
  // Placeholder for actual machine learning model logic
  // In a real implementation, this might involve loading a pre-trained ML model
  // and using it to predict maintenance needs based on the sensor data

  // For demonstration purposes, let's assume the ML model logic is as follows:
  // If the temperature exceeds a threshold, maintenance is needed
  const temperatureThreshold = 75; // Example threshold value
  const maintenanceNeeded = sensorData.temperature > temperatureThreshold;

  return maintenanceNeeded;
};

// Example usage:
const sensorData = {
  temperature: 78, // Example sensor data
  humidity: 45,
  vibration: 0.02
};

console.log(predictMaintenance(sensorData)); // Outputs: true

module.exports = predictMaintenance;
